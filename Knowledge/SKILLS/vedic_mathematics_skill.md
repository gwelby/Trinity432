- System of 16 sutras (formulas) and 13 sub-sutras
- Enables calculations up to 10-100 times faster than conventional methods

### 2. The 16 Sutras
1. **Ekadhikena Purvena** - "By one more than the previous one"
2. **Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah** - "All from 9 and the last from 10"
3. **Urdhva-Tiryagbyham** - "Vertically and crosswise"
4. **Paravartya Yojayet** - "Transpose and adjust"
5. **Shunyam Saamyasamuccaye** - "When the sum is the same, that sum is zero"
6. **Anurupye Shunyamanyat** - "If one is in ratio, the other is zero"
7. **Sankalana-vyavakalanabhyam** - "By addition and by subtraction"
8. **Puranapuranabyham** - "By the completion or non-completion"
9. **Chalana-Kalanabyham** - "Differences and similarities"
10. **Yaavadunam** - "Whatever the extent of its deficiency"
11. **Vyashtisamanstih** - "Part and whole"
12. **Shesanyankena Charamena** - "The remainders by the last digit"
13. **Sopaantyadvayamantyam** - "The ultimate and twice the penultimate"
14. **Ekanyunena Purvena** - "By one less than the previous one"
15. **Gunitasamuchyah** - "The product of the sum is equal to the sum of the products"
16. **Gunakasamuchyah** - "The factors of the sum are equal to the sum of the factors"

### 3. Quantum Connection
- Vedic Mathematics operates through pattern recognition rather than sequential calculation
- Calculations exist in superposition until "observed" in final form
- Mathematical operations follow phi-harmonic relationships
- System maps directly to quantum computational approaches
