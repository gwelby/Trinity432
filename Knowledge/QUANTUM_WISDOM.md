- Crystals teach us about natural symmetry and order
- Some quantum computers even use crystal structures to store quantum states!

### Fun Connections
1. **Plasma Patterns**
   - Plasma balls demonstrate electron behavior
   - Similar to how our quantum archive branches through different compression methods
   - Nature's own quantum visualization!

2. **Crystal Structures**
