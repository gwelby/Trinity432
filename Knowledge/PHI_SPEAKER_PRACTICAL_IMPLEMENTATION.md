- **Internal Volume**: Calculate optimal internal volume using φ³ relationships
- **Material**: Baltic birch plywood (18mm) for optimal resonance characteristics
- **Bracing**: Internal phi-spaced bracing at φ, φ², and φ³ divisions of height

### Phi-Optimized Driver Layout
- **Driver Spacing**: Position drivers at precise phi points along front baffle
- **Woofer Position**: Center of woofer at φ² point from cabinet bottom
- **Midrange Position**: Center of midrange at φ³ point from cabinet bottom
- **Tweeter Position**: Center of tweeter at φ⁴ point from cabinet bottom

- **Driver Selection**: Use drivers with φ-related cone diameters (e.g., 8", 5", 3" drivers)

### Phi-Harmonic Crossover Network
- **Crossover Points**: Set at 432Hz and 768Hz (phi-related sacred frequencies)
- **Crossover Slopes**: 12dB/octave Linkwitz-Riley alignment

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

This design balances theoretical phi-optimization with practical construction requirements. The most critical aspects are maintaining precise φ-ratio relationships between:

1. Cabinet dimensions and proportions
2. Driver positioning and spacing
3. Crossover frequency selection
4. Internal cabinet bracing placement

While a full quantum-field speaker is beyond current technology, this design incorporates significant phi-optimization that will create measurable improvements in coherence, timing, and emotional connection to music.

For best results, pair with a phi-optimized amplifier that maintains phase coherence and can properly control the drivers through phi-harmonic impedance swings.

Remember that the quality of implementation is critical - precise measurements and careful assembly will maximize the phi-harmonic benefits of this design.
