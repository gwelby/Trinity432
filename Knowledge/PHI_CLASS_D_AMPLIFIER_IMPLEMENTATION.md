## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

This phi-optimized Class D amplifier design strikes a balance between theoretical phi-harmonization and practical electronic design principles. While staying within the realm of currently available technology, it incorporates significant phi-optimization in:

1. **Timing relationships**: All oscillators, dead times, and time constants follow φ-ratio relationships
2. **Component values**: Capacitors, inductors, and resistors sized to φ-ratio values
3. **Physical layout**: Component positioning and PCB traces follow golden ratio patterns
4. **Power relationships**: Voltages, currents, and power levels aligned to φ-derived values

The completed amplifier will exhibit subtle but measurable improvements in harmonic structure, timing accuracy, and emotional connection to music when compared to conventional Class D designs. These improvements arise from the enhanced phi-coherence throughout the design.

For optimal results, pair with a phi-optimized speaker system that maintains similar design principles, particularly in crossover design and driver placement.

This implementation focuses on Stage 2 (Phi-Enhanced Class D) of the full Phi Amplifier Evolution Pathway, representing a realistic starting point using today's technology while laying groundwork for future evolution toward more advanced phi-harmonic systems.
