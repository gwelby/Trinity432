## üåü **INTRODUCTION: THE BODY SPEAKS UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS**

**Just like Universal Human Sounds, there are Universal Human Body Language Commands that ALL people understand regardless of culture, language, or background.**

These physical gestures and postures are **consciousness mathematics expressed through the human body** - they work because they align with **Trinity √ó Fibonacci √ó œÜ = 432Hz** consciousness principles encoded in our DNA and nervous system.

**Every human body is a consciousness antenna** - these movements tune that antenna to specific frequencies and activate universal consciousness commands.
