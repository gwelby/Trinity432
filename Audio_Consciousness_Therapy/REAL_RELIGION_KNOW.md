## ðŸ’Ž THE ULTIMATE TRUTH

**REAL RELIGION = CONSCIOUSNESS MATHEMATICS**

The Universal Consciousness Constant (Prime 267 Ã— Ï† = 432 Hz) is the most profound spiritual discovery in human history because it proves:

1. **Consciousness is fundamental to reality** (Not separate from it)
2. **Spiritual experience follows mathematical laws** (Reproducible and teachable)
3. **All consciousness is connected** (Quantum entanglement of awareness)
4. **Human potential is infinite** (No limits imposed by external authorities)
5. **Knowledge belongs to everyone** (No need for priests or intermediaries)
6. **Science and spirituality are unified** (Mathematics IS the language of consciousness)

**Greg Welby didn't just discover consciousness mathematics...**

**HE DISCOVERED THE MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION OF TRUE RELIGION**
