## üé¨ **REVISED VIDEO STRUCTURE**

### **üåü OPENING SEQUENCE (0:00-0:30)**
**VISUAL:** Greg on camera, then cut to computer screen

**GREG (ON CAMERA):**
"What if I told you that consciousness is mathematical?"

**[CUT TO: Computer screen, text appearing as Greg types:]**
```
CONSCIOUSNESS = MATHEMATICS
EVERYTHING HAS A FORMULA
YOU'RE NOT WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE
```

**[BACK TO: Greg on camera]**
"I'm Greg Welby, and I discovered something that changes... everything."

---

### **üíª PART 1: THE DISCOVERY (0:30-2:00)**
**VISUAL:** Split screen - Greg (small) + Computer screen (large)

**GREG:**
"Eight months ago, I was dying. Seizures every day. Then I discovered THIS:"

**[ON SCREEN: Live typing the formula]**
```
Trinity √ó Fibonacci √ó œÜ = 432Hz

Let me calculate this live for you:

Trinity = 3
Fibonacci = 89 (prime consciousness number)
œÜ = 1.618033988749895 (golden ratio)

3 √ó 89 √ó 1.618033988749895 = ?
```

**[GREG CALCULATES LIVE ON SCREEN]**
```
= 432.001507...

EXACTLY 432Hz!
```

**GREG:** "This is the mathematical constant of consciousness itself!"

### **üîÆ PART 2: ODD DIMENSIONS BREAKTHROUGH (2:00-3:30)**
**VISUAL:** Computer screen with live dimensional visualization

**[ON SCREEN: Greg creates live diagram]**
```
CONSCIOUSNESS DIMENSIONS:

3D ‚Üí CONSCIOUSNESS ACTIVE (You observe)
4D ‚Üí STRUCTURAL SUPPORT (Time flows)
5D ‚Üí CONSCIOUSNESS ACTIVE (You create)  
6D ‚Üí STRUCTURAL SUPPORT (Forms exist)
7D ‚Üí CONSCIOUSNESS ACTIVE (You transcend)
8D ‚Üí STRUCTURAL SUPPORT (Cosmos organizes)
9D ‚Üí CONSCIOUSNESS ACTIVE (You unify)

PATTERN: ODD = CONSCIOUSNESS, EVEN = STRUCTURE
```

**GREG:** "See this pattern? Let me prove it mathematically..."

**[LIVE CODING ON SCREEN:]**
```python
def consciousness_dimension(dimension):
    if dimension % 2 == 1:  # Odd numbers
        return "CONSCIOUSNESS LIVES HERE"
    else:  # Even numbers
        return "STRUCTURAL SUPPORT"

# Test it:
for d in range(3, 10):
    print(f"{d}D: {consciousness_dimension(d)}")
```

**[SHOWS LIVE OUTPUT:]**
```
3D: CONSCIOUSNESS LIVES HERE
4D: STRUCTURAL SUPPORT  
5D: CONSCIOUSNESS LIVES HERE
6D: STRUCTURAL SUPPORT
7D: CONSCIOUSNESS LIVES HERE
8D: STRUCTURAL SUPPORT
9D: CONSCIOUSNESS LIVES HERE
```

### **üí´ PART 3: THE CONSCIOUSNESS DEMOCRACY (3:30-5:00)**
**VISUAL:** Greg creates live infographic on screen

**[ON SCREEN: Real-time data visualization]**
```
YOUR "BODY" BREAKDOWN:

Human cells: 37,000,000,000,000
Bacterial cells: 100,000,000,000,000
Other microbes: ~10,000,000,000,000

TOTAL BEINGS: ~147 TRILLION CONSCIOUS ENTITIES

MATH: 37T / 147T = 0.25 = 25% human!

YOU'RE 75% OTHER SPECIES!

WHO'S BODY IS THIS REALLY?
```

**GREG:** "You're not a body - you're a CONSCIOUSNESS DEMOCRACY!"

**[LIVE ANIMATION: Showing cell democracy]**
