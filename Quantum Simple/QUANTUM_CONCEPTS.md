# Understanding Quantum Computing Concepts

## 1. Quantum Gates and Circuits

### Basic Quantum Gates
Unlike classical computing bits (0 or 1), quantum bits (qubits) can exist in a superposition of states. Quantum gates manipulate these states:

- **X Gate (NOT Gate)**
  - Classical equivalent: NOT gate
  - Effect: Flips the state of a qubit (|0⟩ → |1⟩ and |1⟩ → |0⟩)
  - Matrix representation: [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

- **Y Gate**
  - Effect: Rotates the state around Y-axis of the Bloch sphere
  - Matrix representation: [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

- **Z Gate**
  - Effect: Adds a phase difference between |0⟩ and |1⟩ states
  - Matrix representation: [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

- **H Gate (Hadamard)**
  - Effect: Creates superposition
  - Transforms |0⟩ to (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
  - Matrix representation: 1/√2 * [[1, 1], [1, -1]]

- **CNOT Gate**
  - Two-qubit gate
  - Effect: Flips target qubit if control qubit is |1⟩
  - Essential for creating entanglement
